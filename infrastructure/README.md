# Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer provides common utilities and configuration management for the quantitative trading platform.

## Current Structure

```
infrastructure/
├── utils/              # Common utilities and helper functions
├── config/             # Configuration management (future)
├── monitoring/         # System monitoring (future)
└── logging/            # Centralized logging (future)
```

## Current Implementation

**Utils Directory**: Contains common utilities and helper functions used across the platform. These provide shared functionality for database connections, data loading, and common operations.

**Configuration Management**: Currently handled via environment variables and Docker configuration. Future expansion will include centralized configuration management.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Currently integrated within Airflow DAGs and Docker containers. Future expansion will include dedicated monitoring and logging infrastructure.

## Integration with Platform

The infrastructure layer supports the platform by:
- Providing reusable utilities for data processing
- Supporting environment-specific configurations
- Enabling consistent patterns across components
- Preparing for production deployment requirements

## Future Capabilities

When expanded, this layer will provide:
- Centralized configuration management
- Structured logging and monitoring
- Security and compliance frameworks
- Performance profiling and optimization tools

## Current Usage

Infrastructure components are used directly within:
- Airflow DAGs for common operations
- Docker containers for service configuration
- Database initialization and management
- CI/CD deployment processes

The infrastructure layer maintains the foundation for the platform while remaining simple and focused on current needs.

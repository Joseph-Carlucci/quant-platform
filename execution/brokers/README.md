# Broker Integration

The brokers directory handles broker integrations for order execution. Currently, this contains placeholder components for future development.

## Current Status

This directory is prepared for future broker integrations when trading capabilities are added to the platform. The current focus is on data ingestion, model execution, and performance testing.

## Future Broker Support

When implemented, this directory will provide:
- Abstract broker interface for consistent API
- Simulation broker for backtesting and paper trading
- Live broker integrations (Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, etc.)
- Order management and execution tracking
- Transaction cost analysis and execution quality monitoring

## Current Alternatives

For immediate trading needs, consider:
- Paper trading through broker APIs directly
- Third-party execution management systems
- Manual execution with performance tracking

The broker integration framework will be implemented as trading capabilities are added to the platform.

# Execution Layer

The execution layer handles order management and broker integration. Currently, this layer is prepared for future development.

## Current Status

This layer contains placeholder components and will be implemented as trading capabilities are added to the platform. The current focus is on the data ingestion, model execution, and performance testing components of the end-to-end example.

## Structure

```
execution/
├── README.md           # This file
└── brokers/            # Broker integration components (future)
```

## Future Capabilities

When implemented, this layer will handle:
- Order management and execution
- Broker API integration
- Risk management and position sizing
- Transaction cost analysis

## Current Alternatives

For immediate trading needs, consider:
- Paper trading environments for strategy validation
- Direct broker API integration
- Third-party execution management systems

# Model Testing Layer

The model testing layer provides validation and testing infrastructure for quantitative trading models. Currently, this layer contains placeholder components for future development.

## Current Structure

```
model_testing/
├── backtesting/        # Historical simulation (future)
├── forward_testing/    # Paper trading validation (future)
├── validation/         # Cross-validation (future)
└── benchmarking/       # Performance benchmarking (future)
```

## Current Status

This layer is prepared for future model validation capabilities. The current focus is on the end-to-end example with basic performance testing implemented in the DAGs.

## Current Testing Approach

Model testing is currently handled by:
- End-to-end performance testing DAG that evaluates strategy performance
- Basic performance metrics calculation (Sharpe ratio, total returns, drawdown)
- Model ranking and comparison in the database
- Simple backtesting logic within the performance testing workflow

## Future Capabilities

When expanded, this layer will provide:
- Comprehensive backtesting framework with realistic execution simulation
- Walk-forward validation and cross-validation methodologies
- Statistical significance testing and overfitting prevention
- Real-time paper trading for final validation
- Multi-benchmark comparison and performance attribution

## Integration with Platform

Currently integrates with:
- Performance testing DAG for basic model evaluation
- Model registry for tracking tested strategies
- Database storage for performance results and rankings

## Best Practices for Current Implementation

- Use the end-to-end performance testing DAG for strategy evaluation
- Monitor performance metrics in the database
- Compare strategies using the built-in ranking system
- Plan for future expansion of testing capabilities as needed

The model testing layer provides basic validation capabilities while remaining focused on the current end-to-end example implementation.
